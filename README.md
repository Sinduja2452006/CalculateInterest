# Bank Interest Calculator

This is a simple Java program that calculates the maturity amount for a Recurring Deposit account. 
The user first enters how many test cases to run, and then gives the tenure, principal, age, and gender for each case.
The program checks if the values are valid and then prints the deposited amount, the interest earned, and the maturity value. 
If the input is invalid, it shows an error message. 
This project is mainly for practicing Java basics like classes, inheritance, exception handling, and user input.
